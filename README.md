## Overview

Right after graduating from the university, I became interested in the artificial intelligence field (mainly due to the hype of Google releasing TensorFlow - 1.0.0), after a lot of reading about the subject, instead of just learning how to use a library like TensorFlow I created this project as a sandbox to experiment with artificial neuron network (ANN) models.

This project contains a small library called "janns" that implements many common neuron network components from scratch in Java, using object-oriented and academic-friendly code, with no complex matrix calculations.

The library package is used by a small game called "jpanzer" which is essentially a self-play game with AI agents, each one of these agents (called Apha and Beta) controls a tank on the board,Â they can move in 4 directions and shoots, the goal is shooting the opponent but other actions like moving can also give the agents score points, a genetic algorithm is used to evolve the models, the average score of hundreds of rounds is used as the fitness function.

The first generation is completely random and quite boring to watch but later generations usually evolve some interesting behavior such as moving diagonally by alternatively moving 1 pixel in each frame.
